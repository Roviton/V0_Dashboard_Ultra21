-- Fix RLS infinite recursion during registration
-- This script completely removes problematic policies and creates simple, safe ones

-- First, disable RLS temporarily to clean up

ALTER TABLE users DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Drop all existing policies that might cause recursion
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow all access to companies for development" ON companies;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow all access to users for development" ON users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own company" ON companies;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view users in their company" ON users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Company admins can manage their company" ON companies;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Company users can view their profile" ON users;

-- Drop any helper functions that might cause recursion
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS auth.get_user_company_id();
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS public.get_user_company_id();
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS get_user_company_id();

-- Re-enable RLS
ALTER TABLE companies ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE users ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
